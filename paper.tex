% some very useful LaTeX packages include:

%\usepackage{cite}      % Written by Donald Arseneau
                        % V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format
                        % of the cite.sty package \cite{} output to follow
                        % that of IEEE. Loading the cite package will
                        % result in citation numbers being automatically
                        % sorted and properly "ranged". i.e.,
                        % [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6]
                        % (without using cite.sty)
                        % will become:
                        % [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] (using cite.sty)
                        % cite.sty's \cite will automatically add leading
                        % space, if needed. Use cite.sty's noadjust option
                        % (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this
                        % off. cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
                        % systems. The latest version can be obtained at:

%\usepackage{psfrag}    % Written by Craig Barratt, Michael C. Grant,
                        % and David Carlisle
                        % This package allows you to substitute LaTeX
                        % commands for text in imported EPS graphic files.
                        % In this way, LaTeX symbols can be placed into
                        % graphics that have been generated by other
                        % applications. You must use latex->dvips->ps2pdf
                        % workflow (not direct pdf output from pdflatex) if
                        % you wish to use this capability because it works
                        % via some PostScript tricks. Alternatively, the
                        % graphics could be processed as separate files via
                        % psfrag and dvips, then converted to PDF for
                        % inclusion in the main file which uses pdflatex.

%\usepackage{stfloats}  % Written by Sigitas Tolusis
                        % Gives LaTeX2e the ability to do double column

                        % (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally
                        % possible in LaTeX2e). This is an invasive package
                        % which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e output
                        % routines. It may not work with other packages that
                        % modify the LaTeX2e output routine and/or with other
                        % versions of LaTeX. The latest version and
                        % documentation can be obtained at:

                        % comments as well as in the presfull.pdf file.
                        % Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as
                        % IEEE does not allow \baselineskip to stretch.
                        % Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
                        % that IEEE rarely uses double column equations and
                        % that authors should try to avoid such use.
                        % Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or
                        % midfloat.sty package (by the same author) as IEEE
                        % does not format its papers in such ways.

\usepackage{amsmath}    % From the American Mathematical Society
                        % A popular package that provides many helpful commands
                        % for dealing with mathematics. Note that the AMSmath
                        % package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000 thus
                        % preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline
                        % equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
                        % after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks
                        % as IEEEtran.cls normally does. amsmath.sty is already
                        % installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version
                        % and documentation can be obtained at:
                        % http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/amslatex/math/


\usepackage{amssymb}
\usepackage{mathtools}
\usepackage{physics}

% Other popular packages for formatting tables and equations include:

%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty which improves the
% LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better appearances and
% additional user controls. array.sty is already installed on most systems.
% The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/tools/

% V1.6 of IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can
% be used to generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc.

% Also of notable interest:
% Scott Pakin's eqparbox package for creating (automatically sized) equal
% width boxes. Available:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/supported/eqparbox/

% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.

\section{Introduction}
	% \PARstart{}{} creates a tall first letter for this first paragraph
	\PARstart{F}{orces} implemented in Chaste are developed for simulation advantages. Initially we worked on a repulsion force ensuring capsules do not visiulaise with overlapping spheres (\textbf{See: Hertz model?}), subsequently experimentalists observe that certain bacteria will grow a population that is chain like in formation. As a response to these findings (\textbf{data?}) we have worked on implementing the following into the chaste project.
	\begin{enumerate}
	    \item An adhesion force applied only the to ends of simulated bacteria capsules
	    \item An alignment force applied to capsules, causing straight line alignments
	\end{enumerate}

% Main Part
\section{Bacterial Capsules}
	Consider a bacterial capsule to be the construction of a cylinder and two hemispheres, such that a capsule is formed in $\mathbb{R}^n$. Let each capsule be $C_i$ and the determining attributes be a length $l_i$ and a radius $r_i$, such that $C_i = l_i+r_i$. This capsule is abstracted to a a problem of sliding spheres on rods and hence is a matter of intersecting spheres. When two capsules interact, say $C_i$ and $C_j$, there is said to be an \textbf{adhesive force} if each capsule, at its end points touches. If this criterion is met, then the capsules will adhere to each other. If the angle, $\theta$, that is the angle found to be between the two capsules, is $\frac{\pi}{2} \leq \theta \leq \pi $, then an \textbf{alignment force} will be applied to each capsule so that over time, the capsules will converge to $\theta = \pi$.
\section{Forces}

\subsubsection{Capsules}
\subsubsection{Adhesive ends}
\subsubsection{Alignment}
There are four cases to consider.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Two dimensional alignment
    \item Two dimensional alignment and anti-alignment
    \item Three dimensional alignment
    \item Three dimensional alignment and anti-alignment
\end{enumerate}
\begin{align}
    E   & = -\gamma (t_1\cdot t_2) \\
    F   & = -\nabla E \\
        & = -\gamma \left(\pdv{E}{\theta_1},\pdv{E}{\theta_2}\right)
\end{align}
Such that we seek to find the minimum of $E$.
