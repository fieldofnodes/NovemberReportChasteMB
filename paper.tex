\begin{abstract}
	 Bacilli is the name given to any bacteria shaped like a rod. Chaste (Cancer, Heart and Soft Tissue Environment) has accommodated bacilli bacteria populations by developing an intersecting spheres model to maintain the rod like shape of bacteria during interaction. This \textbf{capsule force} is designed to ensure no capsule overlaps another capsule. As is known Streptobacilli is the name given to bacilli arranged in a chain. Chaste had not developed models to accommodate such chains.

\section{Introduction}
	% \PARstart{}{} creates a tall first letter for this first paragraph
	\PARstart{F}{orces} are implemented in Chaste to aid in the understanding of natural phenomena. These forces are developed for simulation advantages, so as to visualise experimental results of questions posed by researchers in various area of study. Chaste can currently visualise up to three dimensions of simulations with \textit{cell-centre} and vertex \textit{vertex-based} cell populations. It can define different force laws for cell to cell interaction, different cell cycles, different cell proliferative types, to say a few \cite{ChasteCell}. Using an \textit{agile} approach to software development, Chaste develops new projects in directive intense bursts of code development, followed up by refactoring. In a recent code development burst, bacilli shaped cells were developed into working forces of cell cell interactions. This \textbf{capsule force}, $F_c$, operates when two capsules have overlapped by some distance $d$. A repulsive force is applied to the location of any and all capsules with a $d > 0$, meaning the capsules are overlapping by $d$. This $F_c$ only ensure no two capsules will overlap, it does nothing to affecting the topology of the population, namely developing force laws that do two tasks:
	\begin{enumerate}
	    \item Adhesion of capsules at their end points
	    \item Alignment of capsules with angles, $\theta_i < \frac{\pi}{2}$, between any two neighboring capsules, for $i\in P$, $P$ being the population of cells.
	\end{enumerate}
    This report will outline the progress of developing Chaste code to accommodate \textbf{(1)} and \textbf{(2)}. Furthermore, this report will detail visuals relating to development of code. 
% Main Part
\section{Bacterial Capsules and Capsule Force}
	Consider a bacterial capsule to be the construction of a cylinder and two hemispheres, such that a capsule is formed in $\mathbb{R}^n$. Let each capsule be $C_i$ and the determining attributes be a length $l_i$ and a radius $r_i$, such that $C_i = l_i+r_i$. This capsule is abstracted to a a problem of sliding spheres on rods and hence is a matter of intersecting spheres. When two capsules interact, say $C_i$ and $C_j$, there is said to be an \textbf{adhesive force} if each capsule, at its end points touches. If this criterion is met, then the capsules will adhere to each other. If the angle, $\theta$, that is the angle found to be between the two capsules, is $\frac{\pi}{2} \leq \theta \leq \pi $, then an \textbf{alignment force} will be applied to each capsule so that over time, the capsules will converge to $\theta = \pi$.
	\begin{figure}[H]
	    \centering
	    \includegraphics[scale = 0.22]{TwoCapsules.png}
	    \caption{Rod shaped capsules visualised in ParaView}
	    \label{fig:two_capsules}
	\end{figure}
		\begin{figure}[H]

	    \includegraphics[scale = 0.32]{AnatomyOfCapsules.png}
	    \caption{Anatomy of a capsule}
	    \label{fig:anatomy_capsules}
	\end{figure}
	Consider that a capsule is considered to be the sum of a tube and two hemispheres, then for capsule \textbf{a}, say $C_a$ is $C_a=2r_a+l_a$. Then this model of capsules can be reduced to models of intersecting spheres. Suppose then, that two capsules overlap.
	\begin{figure}[H]
	    \centering
	    \includegraphics[scale = 0.22]{OverlappingCapsules.png}
	    \caption{Two capsules overlapping}
	    \label{fig:overlapping_capsules}
	\end{figure}
	Figure 3 shows two overlapping capsules. The overlapping dotted circles are re-visualised as shown below.
	\begin{figure}[H]
	    \centering
	    \includegraphics[scale = 0.52]{SkeletonOverlap.png}
	    \caption{Labelled overlap}
	    \label{fig:skeleton_overlap}
	\end{figure}	
    Two capsules overlapping are said to have an overlap, $d>0$ and two capsules that are neighbors and not overlapping have $d<0$. Under the $F_c$(\textbf{capsule force}), these two capsules' locations will be mutually repelled until $d<0\rightarrow d = 0$, thus, reaching a stable state. In reference to Figure 2, consider $l$ to be a directed vector in space (up to$\mathbb{R}^3$), then capsule interaction is reduced to vectors and spheres in space. 
\section{Forces}

\subsubsection{Capsules}
\subsubsection{Adhesive ends}
\subsubsection{Alignment}
There are four cases to consider.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Two dimensional alignment
    \item Two dimensional alignment and anti-alignment
    \item Three dimensional alignment
    \item Three dimensional alignment and anti-alignment
\end{enumerate}
\begin{align}
    E   & = -\gamma (t_1\cdot t_2) \\
    F   & = -\nabla E \\
        & = -\gamma \left(\pdv{E}{\theta_1},\pdv{E}{\theta_2}\right)
\end{align}
Such that we seek to find the minimum of $E$.
